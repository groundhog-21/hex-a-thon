# Explainable Survival: From Prediction to Trust in Hex

👉 **Public Hex Project:** [View in Hex](https://app.hex.tech/virtual-hackathon/app/031rWcGGGHC7gjaILdmufL/latest)

This repository contains local experimentation, modeling, and explainability work
supporting a Hex-a-thon project focused on **explainable machine learning**.

The primary deliverable is an interactive ML application built and published in **Hex**.
This repository serves as the development and experimentation environment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to reframe the classic Titanic survival prediction problem
as a **model trust and interpretability challenge**, rather than a leaderboard optimization task.

Key themes:
- Reproducible ML pipelines
- Model diagnostics and error analysis
- Explainability using SHAP
- Clear separation between experimentation and presentation

---

## What this repository is

- Local experimentation, modeling, and validation in Python
- Feature engineering, error analysis, and explainability experiments
- Supporting material for the final Hex application

## What this repository is not

- This is not the deployed application
- The interactive app and AI-powered Threads live in Hex

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- SHAP
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter
- Hex (notebooks, apps, Threads)

## Notes

- The final user-facing experience lives in Hex.
- This repository is intentionally scoped to modeling and analysis rather than deployment.
- Model performance is secondary to interpretability and usability.
